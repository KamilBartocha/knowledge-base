# Certified Tester Advanced Level Test Automation Engineer
#### Version 2.0

*Materials based on official @International Software Testing Qualifications Board Syllabus.*

## 1. Test Automation Engineering in Software Testing

The Test Automation Engineering qualification is designed for professionals involved in software testing and automation, including roles like testers, test analysts, automation engineers, consultants, architects, and developers. It is also relevant for those seeking a basic understanding of automation, such as project managers, quality managers, business analysts, and IT directors.

The syllabus is aimed at test engineers implementing or improving test automation, focusing on sustainable methods and practices. While not teaching software engineering, it requires expertise in the field and familiarity with programming standards, best practices, and industry guidelines to ensure maintainability, reliability, and security of test automation solutions.

## 2. Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives support business outcomes and are used to create the Certified Tester Test
Automation Engineering exams.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable at a K2, K3 and K4 levels, except for the Introduction and Appendices. That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or concept mentioned in any of the eight chapters. The specific learning objectives levels are
shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:
-  K2: Understand
-  K3: Apply
-  K4: Analyze

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in Appendix A.
All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered, even if not explicitly
mentioned in the learning objectives.

## 3. The Test Automation Engineering Certificate Exam

The Test Automation Engineering Certificate exam is based on the syllabus, and all sections except the Introduction and Appendices are examinable. While standards and books are referenced, only the syllabus content is testable.

To take the exam, candidates should have an interest in software testing and automation. It is recommended that candidates have at least six months of experience in software testing or development and take an ISTQB-accredited course. The ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate is required before taking the Test Automation Engineering exam.

The test consists of **40 questions** and lasts a maximum of 60 minutes (75 minutes for non-native speakers). Each correct answer is worth 1 point. To pass the exam, you must score at least 65% (26 or more points). The questions are multiple-choice.
