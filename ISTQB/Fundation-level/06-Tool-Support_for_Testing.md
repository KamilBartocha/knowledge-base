# **6 Tools Support for Testing**
# 6.1 Test Tool Considerations
Test tools can be used to support one or more testing activities. Such tools include:
- Tools that are directly **used in testing**, such as test execution tools and test data preparation tools
- Tools that help to **manage requirements**, test cases, test procedures, automated test scripts, test results, test data, and defects
- Tools that are used for **analysis and evaluation**
- **Any tool that assists in testing** (a spreadsheet is also a test tool in this meaning)

## 6.1.1 Test Tool Classification
Test tools can have one or more of the following purposes depending on the context:
- Improve the efficiency of test activities by **automating repetitive tasks**
- Improve the efficiency of test activities by **supporting manual test activities**
- Improve the quality of test activities by allowing for **more consistent testing** and a higher level of defect reproducibility
- **Automate activities** that cannot be executed manually
- **Increase reliability** of testing
## Tools types. Tool support for:
- management of testing and testware
- static testing
- test design and implementation
- test execution and logging
- performance measurement and dynamic analysis
- specialized testing needs
## 6.1.2 Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
Potential **benefits** of using tools to support test execution include:
- Reduction in repetitive manual work
- Greater consistency and repeatability
- More objective assessment
- Easier access to information about testing

Potential **risks** of using tools to support testing include:
- Expectations for the tool may be unrealistic
- The time, cost and effort for the initial introduction of a tool may be under-estimated
- The time and effort needed to achieve significant and continuing benefits from the tool may be under-estimated
- The effort required to maintain the test work products generated by the tool may be under-estimated
- The tool may be relied on too much
- Version control of test work products may be neglected
- Relationships and interoperability issues between critical tools may be neglected
- The tool vendor may go out of business, retire the tool
- The vendor may provide a poor response for support, upgrades, and defect fixes
- An open source project may be suspended
- A new platform or technology may not be supported by the tool
- There may be no clear ownership of the tool

## 6.1.3 Special Considerations for Test Execution and Test Management Tools

**Test execution tools** execute test objects using automated test scripts. This type of tools often requires significant effort in order to achieve significant benefits.
- **Capturing test approach**: Capturing tests by recording the actions of a manual tester seems attractive, but this approach does not scale to large numbers of test scripts. A captured script is a linear representation with specific data and actions as part of each script.
- **Data-driven test approach**: This test approach separates out the test inputs and expected results, and uses a more generic test script that can read the input data and execute the same test script with different data.
- **Keyword-driven test approach**: This test approach, a generic script processes keywords describing the actions to be taken, which then calls keyword scripts to process the associated test data.
# 6.2 Effective Use of Tools
## 6.2.1 Main Principles for Tool Selection
The main considerations:
- Assessment of the **maturity of the own organization**, its strengths and weaknesses
- **Identification of opportunities** for an improved test process supported by tools
- **Understanding of the technologies** used by the test object(s), in order to select a tool that is compatible with that technology
- Understanding the build and continuous integration tools already in use within the organization, in order to **ensure tool compatibility and integration**
- **Evaluation of the tool against clear requirements** and objective criteria
- Consideration of whether or not the tool is available for a free trial period
- **Evaluation of the vendor**
- Identification of internal requirements for **coaching and mentoring** in the use of the tool
- Consideration of pros and cons of various licensing models
- Estimation of a cost-benefit ratio based on a concrete business case
## 6.2.2 Pilot Projects for Introducing a Tool into an Organization
After completing the tool selection and a successful proof-of-concept, introducing the selected tool into an organization generally starts with a pilot project
- Gaining in-depth knowledge about the tool, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses
- Evaluating how the tool fits with existing processes and practices, and determining what would
need to change
- Deciding on standard ways of using, managing, storing, and maintaining the tool and the test work products (e.g., deciding on naming conventions for files and tests, selecting coding standards, creating libraries and defining the modularity of test suites)
- Assessing whether the benefits will be achieved at reasonable cost
- Understanding the metrics that you wish the tool to collect and report, and configuring the tool to
ensure these metrics can be captured and reported

## 6.2.3 Success Factors for Tools
Success factors for evaluation, implementation, deployment, and on-going support of tools within an organization include:
- Rolling out the tool to the rest of the organization incrementally
- Adapting and improving processes to fit with the use of the tool
- Providing training, coaching, and mentoring for tool users
- Defining guidelines for the use of the tool
- Implementing a way to gather usage information from the actual use of the tool
- Monitoring tool use and benefits
- Providing support to the users of a given tool
- Gathering lessons learned from all users
