# **3 Static Testing**
# 3.1 Static Testing Basics
In contrast to dynamic testing, which requires the execution of the software being tested, static testing 
relies on the manual examination of work products. Almost any work product can be can be examinated using
static testing.

### Types of work products in static testing:
- revievs
- static analysis
## 3.1.2 Benefits of Static Testing
- Enables early detection of defects
- Defects found early are often much cheaper to remove
- Identifying defects which are not easly found by dynamic testing
- Increasing development productivity
- Reducing development and testinmg cost time
- Improving communication between team members
## 3.1.3 Differences between Static and Dynamic Testing
Static testing and dynamic testing have the same objectives (providing an assessment of the quality).
One main distinction is that static testing finds defects in work products directly, rather than identifying failures when the software is run.

Typical static tests defects:
- Requirement defects
- Design defects
- Coding defects
- Deviations form standards
- Incorrect interface specyfications
- Security volnerabilities
# 3.2 Review Proscess
 Reviews vary from informal to formal. Informal reviews are characterized by not following a defined process and not
 having formal documented output. Formal reviews are characterized by team participation, documented results of the review, and documented procedures for conducting the review.

 ## 3.2.1 Work Product Review Process
 The review process comprises the following main activities
 - Planning 
 - Initate review
 - Individual review
 - Issue communication and analysis
 - Fixing and reporting

 ## 3.2.2 Roles and responsibilities in a formal review
 - Author
 - Management
 - Facilitator
 - Review leader
 - Reviewers
 - Scribe
 ## 3.2.3 Review Types
 - Informal review
 - Walkthrough
 - Technical review
 - Inspection
 ## 3.2.4 Applying Review Techniques
 - Ad hoc
 - Checklist-based
 - Scenarios and dry runs
 - Perspective-based
 - Role-based
 ## 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews
 **Organizational:**
- Each reciew has clear objectives
- Review types are applied which are suitable to achieve the objectives
- Any checklists are up to date
- Participants have adequate time to prepare
- Reviews are scheduled with adequate notiec
- Management supports the review process

**People-related:** 
- The right people are involved
- Testers are seen as valued reviewers
- Participants dedicate adequate time and attention to detail
- Defects found are acknowledged, appreciated, and handled objectively
- The meeting is well-managed
- Adequate training is provided
