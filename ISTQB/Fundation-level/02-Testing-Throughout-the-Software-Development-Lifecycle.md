# **2 Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle**
# 2.1 Software Development Lifecycle Models
A software development lifecycle model describes the types of activity performed at each stage in a software development project, and how the activities relate to one another logically and chronologically.

Characteristics of a good testing:
- For every develompment activity, there is a corrresponding test activity
- Each test level has test objectives specyfic to that level
- Test analysis and design is done in right time
- Testers participate in discussions to define requirments as soon as possible
# 2.2 Test Levels
Test levels are groups of test activities that are organized and managed together. Each test level is an instance of the test process.
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

# 2.3 Test Types
A test type is a group of test activities aimed at testing specific characteristics of a software system, or a part of a system, based on specific test objectives. Types:
- Functional Testing
- Non-functional Testing
- White-box Testing
- Change-related Testing(confirmation testing and regression testing)
# 2.4 Maintenance Testing
### Triggers for Maintenance:
- Modification (new versions)
- Migration (another platform)
- Archiving the tests. 

### Impact Analysis for Maintenence

Impact Analysis evaluates the changes that were made for a maintenance release to:
- Identify the intended consequences
- Identyfy expected and side effects of a change
- Identyfy the areas in the system that will be afected
- Identyfy impact of a cheange on existing tests
