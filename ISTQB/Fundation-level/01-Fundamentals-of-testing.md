# **1 Fundamentals of Testing**
# 1.1 What is Testing?
**Software testing** is a process which includes:
- test planning,
- analyzing,
- designing,
- implementing tests,
- reporting test progress and results
- evaluating the quality of a test object. 

## 1.1.1 Typical Objectives of Testing
- To prevent defects
- To verify whether all specified requirements have been fulfilled
- To check whether the test object is complete
- To build confidence it the level of quality of the test object
- To find defects
- To provide sufficient informations to stakeholders
- To comply with contractual, legal etc. requirements or standards

## 1.1.2 Testing vs Debugging
- **Testing**: Validation if test object fulfilled requirements (finding bugs)
- **Debuging**: Develolopment activity that finds, analyzes and fixes defects.

# 1.2 Why is Testing Necessary?
Rigorous testing of components and systems, and their associated documentation, can help reduce the risk of failures occurring during operation.

# 1.2.2 Quality Assurance nad Testing
**Quality management** includes all activities that direct and control an organization with regard to quality.

Quality management includes both quality assurance and quality control. 

**Quality assurance** is typically focused on adherence to proper processes, in order to provide confidence that the appropriate levels of quality will be achieved.

**Quality control** involves test activities, that support the achievement of appropriate levels of quality. Test activities are part of the overall software development or maintenance process. 

**Quality assurance supports proper testing**.

# 1.2.3 Errors, Defects and Failures
`Error (mistake) -> defect(fault or bug) -> Failure`


A person can make an error (mistake), which can lead to the introduction of a defect (fault or bug) in the software code or in some other related work product. 

If a defect in the code is executed, this may cause a failure, but not necessarily in all circumstances.

# 1.3 Seven Testing Principles

1. Testing shows the presense of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time and money
4. Defects cluster together
5. Bewere of pesticide paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-failures is a fallacy

# 1.4 Testing Process
There is no one universal software test process, but there are common sets of test activities without which testing will be less likely to achieve its established objectives.
## 1.4.1 Test Process in Context
Contextual factors that influence the test process:
- Software development lifecycle model and project methodologies
- Test levels and test types
- Product and project risks
- Business domain
- Operational constraints(budget, complexity)
- Organizational policies and practices
- Required internal and external standards 
## 1.4.2 Test Activities and Tasks 
- Test planning
- Test monitoring and control
- Test analysis
- Test design
- Test implementation
- Test execution
- Test completion 
# 1.5 Psychology of testing
Testers needs to be nice. Developers should understand the reason of their existance.
